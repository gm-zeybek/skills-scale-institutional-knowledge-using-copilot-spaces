# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

OctoAcme’s project management processes are designed to ensure structured, transparent, and efficient project delivery across cross-functional teams. Projects begin with robust initiation, where business needs, stakeholders, success metrics, and risks are recorded in a Project One-pager. The planning phase breaks work into prioritized, actionable backlogs, aligns resources, and sets clear milestones. Execution uses daily standups and regular delivery syncs for updates, review, and risk management. Each sprint or milestone has defined acceptance criteria and regular reviews to validate quality and progress.

Key roles are central to OctoAcme’s framework: Project Managers coordinate delivery, timelines, and risk management; Product Managers own product vision and prioritization; Developers build and test features; QA ensures standards are met; and Stakeholders provide input and approvals. Clear ownership for each artifact and process step helps minimize ambiguity and enables effective collaboration.

Communication is paramount, maintained through structured cadences—standups, syncs, and stakeholder updates. All project-critical information (risk registers, status, incident reports) is documented and shared via templates and dashboards, ensuring transparency. Escalation paths for resolving blockers start at the team level and escalate to sponsors or specialized teams for major incidents.

Quality assurance is built into every phase—automated and manual tests (unit, integration, end-to-end), CI security scanning, peer reviews, and deployment checklists. Releases follow verification steps, with post-release monitoring and retrospective meetings to improve team practices. Continuous improvement is driven by retrospectives, capturing lessons learned and tracking action items to foster repeatable operational excellence.

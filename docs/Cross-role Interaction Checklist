# Cross-role Interaction Checklist

This checklist is designed to standardize the expectations, handoffs, and communications between the various personas in OctoAcme’s project management process.

## General

- [ ] Each deliverable has a clearly assigned primary owner and backup.
- [ ] Roles and responsibilities for all major milestones are documented.
- [ ] Key handoffs (e.g., design to dev, dev to QA, release to support) are explicit and scheduled.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are clear, testable, and available to all involved personas.
- [ ] Risks, blockers, and dependency information are shared in sync meetings and tracked in the project system.

## Handoffs

- [ ] UX specs are reviewed and signed off by Developers before implementation begins.
- [ ] QA is involved early to define coverage and test cases.
- [ ] DevOps is notified at least one sprint before any major deployment or integration activity.
- [ ] Security Lead reviews architecture and critical changes before release milestones.
- [ ] Customer Support is provided with updated documentation and change notes before every release.

## Escalations & Decision Rights

- [ ] Blockers are raised in daily standups, then escalated according to the documented escalation path.
- [ ] Decisions impacting multiple teams are documented, with clear rationale and consent from affected roles.

## Retrospectives & Feedback

- [ ] All roles review interaction effectiveness in project/cycle retrospectives.
- [ ] Action items for improving handoffs and communication are tracked and owned.

This checklist should be reviewed and adapted regularly as the team and processes evolve.
